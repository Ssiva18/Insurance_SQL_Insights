Developing END to END SQL project for Insurance data.

    The project is focused on sample real world dataset of Insurance products like MTP and CMBC.
    The main agenda is to walk you through the workflow process of realtime SQL projects in industries.
    We have considered six main tables where data is organized effeciently by following the Normalization methods.
    Most of the data revolves around the insurance policies claims and payments.

    Here I provide you the list of tables we captured for the data analysis.

    -- Customers: This is specific to the customers information.
